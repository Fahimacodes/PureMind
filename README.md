Aim of this project was to create an android mobile application that acts as a platform where counsellors can build a solid relationship with patients to improve their mental health.
Originally developed on Android Studio in Java as part of my BSc Computer Science Final Year Project which independently achieved a First Class.

 ## Abstract 
**Over the years mental health has become a prominent topic of discussion. With it not discriminating with whom it affects, there has been a significant rise in number of people affected, which has made coping an increasingly difficult task. For women, poverty and abuse is a leading cause, “one in five women experience a common mental health disorder in comparison to one in eight men” (Agenda Alliance for Women & Girls at Risk, 2017). Women of colour are at a higher risk, as on top of that they face gender inequality, racism and social stigma. Women often take on the role of carer, not only for their own offspring, but partner, parents and extended relatives. With so much to juggle it can be more laborious than beneficial to allocate constructive time to taking care of themselves. The intention of this project is to provide a means for those suffering with their mental health, primarily women, to connect with the best counsellor, in order to take the first step in improving their wellbeing.**
